## Presentation 

Using the Next.js framework allows you to generate a static site and Netlify is a "Git-based headless CMS", a Git-based headless CMS that communicates with the Github API.

This approach will allow the blog to evolve with the functionality of the CMS and the server-side rendering of the front-end application will allow the use of external services for the improvement of the content.

The [blog](https://blog.httpswebsite.xyz) is hosted on Netlify. It is written by myself in markdown with mdx files. The subjects of the articles are web development and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Tagging**: organizes content by tags
- **Author**: displays author names who write a post
- **Pagination**: limits the number of posts per page
- **CMS**: built with CMS to allow editors modifying content with the quickest way
- **SEO optimized**: built-in metadata like JSON-LD
- **Shortcode**: extends content writing with React component like WordPress shortcodes
